# The blue colour outside the cell represents command mode.
# And the green colour indicates edit mode.
# Press 'Esc' to get into command mode.
# Press 'Enter' to go back into edit mode.
# Press 'P' to view the list of all available commands.
# This is a coding cell.
# Let's write your first Python program here.

Name = input("Enter your name: ")
print("Hello,", Name)

# Press 'Shift + Enter' to execute the cell.
# Writing comments in a code cell can sometimes create confusion. Jupyter notebook works both as a notebook and a coding console. 
# To write explanatory texts, you can use a markdown cell which enables you to format your comments well to create a more
# readable code.

# Let's now learn about markdown cells, then.
# Press 'M' in command mode to convert a code cell to a Markdown cell.
This is a Markdown Cell. Double click on a markdown cell or press 'Enter' to see how it's written. And again, press 'Shift + Enter' to execute the cell.

Let's further learn about the various customizations in a markdown cell to create more readable and understandable code.
# This is a title
## This is a heading
### This is a subheading
#### This is as small as a heading can get
##### The fifth hash makes it Italic. Wow!
## Formatting in Markdown cells

### Emphasis

__"This will appear bold."__

**"So will this."**

_"Just one dash makes it italic."_

*"And one star on either side as well."*

***"This one's both bold and italic."***
### Monospace Fonts

Use a back single quotation mark (\`) to get monospace fonts.

`This text will appear in a monospace font.`
`Python is a beautiful language.`

### Line Breaks

Sometimes in the markdown cells, you don't get a line break where you want simply by pressing enter. In such cases use `<br>` to get a manual line break.

I want a line break here.
But I don't get it. :/
<br>
So I used a manual line break <br>
There we go! :)
### Indenting

Use `>` to indent your text.

This is the first line
> This indents the second line.
>> This further indents it.
>>> And this goes on and on.
### Bullets and Numbering

-  A dash followed by two spaces, i.e. `'-  '` creates a bullet.
    -  Pressing a tab before doing the above creates a sub-bullet.
1. Start with a simple `1. ` (1 followed by a dot and space) to get a numbered list.
2. And keep doing it for further numbers.
    1. Again, just a tab for the sub-bullet.
### Coloring
 
-  <font color = blue> This text will be blue. </font>
-  <font color = yellow> I hate this color! </font>
### Adding an Image

You can add an image from the web by using `<img src = "image_path">`

Example:
<img src = "https://www.upgrad.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/upgrad_logo-1.png">
### LaTeX Equations

Jupyter notebook also supports LaTeX equations. Use a `$` on either side to write a LaTeX equation.

The below example is just a hypothetical equation to explain how you can write LaTeX equations in Jupyter notebook. 
<br>

$(\frac{a_1}{a_2} + \frac{a_3}{a_4})^2 = a_5^3$

Go through this [link](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX/Mathematics) if you want to learn the LaTeX syntax. 
### Basic Commands

That was all about markdown cells. Now let us take a look at the most useful commands that you require every day while coding in the Jupyter notebook.

#### Command Mode Shortcuts
-  `Esc`: To go into command mode
-  `Enter`: To go back to edit mode
-  `M`: To convert a cell to a markdown cell
-  `Y`: To convert a cell back to a code cell
-  `A`: To insert new cell above
-  `B`: To insert new cell below
-  `D + D`: To delete cell
-  `Z`: Undo the last operation
-  `F`: To find and replace on your code
-  `Shift + Up/Down`: To select multiple cells
-  `Space`: Scroll notebook downwards
-  `Shift + Space`: Scroll notebook upwards

#### Edit Mode Shortcuts
-  `Shift + Enter`: To execute the code in the current cell and go to the next cell
-  `Alt + Enter`: To execute the code in the current cell and insert new cell below
-  `Shift + Tab`: To get brief documentation of the object that you have just typed in the coding cell
-  `Ctrl + Shift + -`: To split the cell at cursor
-  `Shift + M`: To merge selected cells

Apart from this, you can also use `H` to open the list of keyboard shortcuts and even add new shortcuts or customize the existing shortcuts according to your personal requirements.
